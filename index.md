  <h1>Infrastructure & Compliance</h1>
  <p>
    We help organizations stabilize the technical and regulatory foundations they
    rely on but rarely inspect. From system design to compliance architecture,
    we reduce risk, improve resilience, and often cut cost in the process.
    Whether you're scaling fast or correcting inherited complexity, we build
    what's missing and fortify what matters.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Anchor Accord is a Boston-based strategic advisory partner for the moments when the edges begin to fray:</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Technical systems cost more but deliver less clarity, alignment, or trust.</li>
    <li>BSA/AML/OFAC risk is mounting with no decisive owner.</li>
    <li>Key staff are stretched thin - or preparing to leave.</li>
    <li>Workflows sprawl, but there's no time to redesign them.</li>
  </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We don’t bring a 50-person team.<br>
  We bring focus, experience, and clarity.</p>


<section id="services" class="scroll-section">
  <h1>Services</h1>
  <p>
    We focus on two domains often treated as cost centers: <strong>infrastructure systems</strong> and
    <strong>regulatory compliance</strong>. In reality, these are leverage points. When aligned,
    they reduce risk, unlock clarity, and stabilize the business beneath the surface.
  </p>
  <p>
    We help you get there - calmly, pragmatically, and without the usual theatre.
  </p>
  <aside class="note-block">
    <strong>What we mean by “systems”:</strong><br>
    Not just apps or servers - but the interconnected people, tools, and decisions that make your work possible. Infrastructure, compliance, automation, judgment. If it interacts, it’s part of the system.

    We specialize in stabilizing operations through grounded, real-world
    systems - not by chasing the latest cloud tool, but by understanding
    how your business actually runs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reactivity often creeps in slowly, in the form of late nights,
    quiet burnout, or one too many heroic catches. Most teams don’t even
    notice the shift at first. They just feel tired. Or stuck. Or like
    everything’s slightly harder than it used to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    What you need is someone who can hear the hum of the system, cut through
    the noise, and show you what’s dragging you off balance. We’ll help you
    reclaim time, clarity, and control - without disrupting the business to do it.

    <summary>Case Study: Scaling, Stalled - How Invisible Infrastructure Debt Drains Product Momentum</summary>
    <p>
     As a firm scaled, repeated technical breakdowns quietly began eating
     into its core mission: instead of accelerating discovery, teams found
     themselves mired in troubleshooting. Infrastructure wasn’t failing
     in dramatic ways, it was just misaligned, invisible, and slow to adapt. Time
     was lost, momentum slipped, and product development suffered. This case
     explores how treating infrastructure as a cost center, rather than a force
     multiplier created drag the company couldn't afford.

  <p>
    Our compliance work focuses on BSA/AML/OFAC and broader financial crimes
    frameworks - bringing clarity, structure, and calm to environments where
    regulatory pressure is high and reactive churn often overwhelms real strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you're preparing for an audit, untangling legacy policies, or
    trying to understand what “good” looks like, we can help. We've led
    strategic remediation, regulatory response, and exam prep across
    both FinTechs and traditional banks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many organizations don’t realize they’re exposed - or even complicit - until
    someone puts the pattern in front of them. We bring that pattern into
    focus, then help you act on it, calmly and responsibly.
  </p>
  <p>
    We don’t hand you a checklist. We work alongside you to rebuild
    confidence - so you're not just compliant on paper, but resilient in practice.

    <summary>Case Study: Signal, not Noise - Assessing and Rebuilding Case Management Systems</summary>
    <p>
    Many institutions treat their transaction monitoring or case management 
    platform as the centerpiece of their financial crime compliance 
    program - without realizing how quickly these tools can become liabilities. In 
    this composited case study, Anchor Accord examines a pattern observed across 
    multiple institutions: unclear system ownership, broken triage workflows, and 
    misaligned alert logic that overwhelms staff while underperforming on actual 
    risk.

<section id="about" class="scroll-section">
  <h1>Our Founders</h1>
  <p>
    Anchor Accord was founded by two senior operators who’ve lived the hard side of systems work.
  </p>
  <p>
    We’ve seen what happens when risk is underestimated, when frameworks get forced, and when ownership diffuses under pressure. Between us, we’ve stabilized systems, rebuilt trust, and designed the structures that kept both infrastructure and compliance aligned under true pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
    We’re not here to sell bodies or build optics. We’re here to bring clarity across <strong>technical and regulatory domains</strong> — especially when the stakes are rising and certainty is thin.
